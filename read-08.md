# Layout
Notes from chapter 15, Layout, from Jon Duckettâ€™s HTML and CSS book
* <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
* Browsers default to displaying pages in normal flow unless relative, absolute, or fixed positioning is selected.
* In normal flow, each block level element sits on top of the next one. This is the way browsers treat HTML elements by default so no CSS property is needed
* Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow
* When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of the other elements on the page or in other words, they act like it is not there
* Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.
* Pages can be a fixed width or liquid layout
* The float property moves content to the left or right of the page
* Screen sizes and display resolutions vary wildly so designers keep web pages to within 960-1000 px wide and the top 600px are usually space used for what the website is about.
* CSS frameworks provide rules for common tasks
* You can include multiple CSS files in one page
* Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch

# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## Lists

Lists in HTML are prtty straight forward, there are three types of lists, order, unordered, and definition.

An ordered list is numbered:

Example:
<ol>
<li>Test one</li>
<li>Test two</li>
<li>Test three</li>
</ol>

An unordered list is just like it sounds, not numbered.

Example:
<ol>
<ul>Apple</ul>
<ul>Banana</ul>
<ul>Watermelon</ul>

A definition list is a list where the list items are usually words or definitions.

Example:
<dl>
<dt>Baseball</dt>
<dd>A bat and ball sport played between two teams of nine players.</dd>
</dl>

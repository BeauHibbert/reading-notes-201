Size of images can be specified so that you can have multiple images all be the same size
Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically
Background images can appear once or multiple times if needed
Image rollover effects can be created by moving the background position of an image
Image sprites can be created to reduce the load time of a webpage if a bunch of images are used
